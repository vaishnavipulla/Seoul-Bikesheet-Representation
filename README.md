Project overview and objectives:

I evaluated the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset utilizing a variety of regression approaches, such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and transformed regression. The goal was to determine which model performed best and was the best at predicting bike rental counts based on weather and seasonal characteristics. As part of this approach, I conducted basic data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), both of which are detailed in the report.

Instructions for setting up and running code:

I set up the environment using Jupyter Notebook, but the project can be opened in any IDE that supports Python, as it was developed entirely in Python.

How the project is structured and files:

The project structure is straightforward, with each section—Exploratory Data Analysis, Quality of Fit, Statistical Summary, and Feature Selection—organized into one Jupyter Notebook file that can be run independently. Additionally, comments are provided throughout the code to clarify the steps and explain the logic behind each process, ensuring ease of understanding.

Any dependencies or libraries required to run the project:

The project dependencies include `numpy`, `sklearn`, `statsmodels`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`. Additionally, you will need the `SeoulBikeData.csv` file, which should already be located in the project folder.
